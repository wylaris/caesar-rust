# Caesar Cipher - Rust #

## Description ##
This is a simple Caesar Cipher written in Rust for the purpose of showing new Rustaceans
about the glories of Rust and some practices I learned on the job.

I recommend running this application with Cargo as it makes the process easier on the user
and allows you to use the following commands

## Execution ##
Execution: `cargo run -- --file tests/simple_test.txt`

Testing: `cargo test`
